# schema_gen

A Clojure library to generate examples which fulfil a supplied Prismatic Schema.

This code is mostly based off of a Gist by Dave Golland:
https://gist.github.com/davegolland/3bc4277fe109e7b11770

With a few additions for other schema elements and types, and a couple of methods to return a list of examples that match a schema.

Currently trying to add functionality for s/pred.
